## AI in Loop RL

When apply Reenforcement leanrning in swarm robotics we facing a major challenge is quickly training the swarm behiver in sumilated environment like Isaacsim. The robots take a long time to develop their behivor to reach a simaple physical movement. While in natural sitution the butterfly culd learn to fly in several try. The guidence we appleid in current RL algrothim has limitted to traning the intraction between body dynamic and physical environment has to cost large ammount computing resources to let the robots has basic physical sensing. The concept we come up is ustlize the LLM(large language model) to acctiavely provide the judgemental optionion for the reward. The LLM we designed/trained has the full understanding of physical pricianple to identify the robots behavior. For example if the 2 wheel robots sunddly fly into the space the AI agent could immidatly chage the reward and avoid the similar situation to happen

**Leveraging Large Language Models for Reward Shaping in Simulated Swarm Robotics**

## üß© Problem Statement

Reinforcement learning in swarm robotics demands immense computational resources and time to develop basic, physically viable behaviors in high-fidelity simulations (e.g., Isaac Sim). Current RL algorithms rely on sparse and delayed environmental rewards, which results in inefficient learning and brittle behaviors. There is a need for an adaptive reward mechanism that incorporates domain knowledge about physical principles and task constraints.

---

## üí° Proposed Solution

Introduce a **Large Language Model (LLM)-based reward agent** that actively observes the robot‚Äôs state-action history and adjusts the reward function based on semantic, judgment-driven evaluation of physical plausibility and task alignment.

The LLM is trained or prompted with:

- Robot-specific physical constraints (e.g., 2-wheeled robot should not fly).
- Common failure modes and biomechanical principles.
- Desired behavioral heuristics (e.g., stability, energy efficiency, swarm cohesion).

## üéØ Objectives

1. Reduce the number of training episodes required for meaningful behavior emergence.
2. Improve physical plausibility and task alignment of robot behaviors.
3. Demonstrate generalization across multiple robot types and tasks.

## üîç Experiment Design

- **Baseline:** Train a 2-wheeled robot with standard reward shaping in Isaac Sim.
- **Intervention:** Introduce LLM-based reward reshaping module that penalizes physically implausible behaviors (e.g., flipping, floating).
- **Metrics:**
	- Time to task convergence
	- Number of implausible behaviors
	- Swarm coordination performance (if applied to multi-agent scenarios)

## üß† Modeling the LLM Agent

- Use GPT-4-turbo or fine-tuned open-weight models.
- Input: JSON logs from simulation (e.g., velocity, torque, collision events).
- Output: Scaled reward or correction signals.
- Optional: Use prompt chaining or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for physical law reference.

## üìö Potential Contributions

- A new framework for **judgment-based reward modeling using LLMs**.
- Demonstration of **LLM + RL hybrid control loop** in high-fidelity robotic simulation.
- Enhanced **sample efficiency and behavior robustness** in swarm learning.
